# POST IT - Ashesi Student Social Network

Welcome to **POST IT**, the ultimate social network application designed exclusively for Ashesi University students. This platform offers a wide range of features to connect and engage with your fellow students, ensuring accuracy, security, and privacy throughout your journey.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Profiles:** Create an account, log in, and personalize your profile. Customize your profile image and other fields to showcase your identity.

- **Post and Discover:** View posts made by other users, share your thoughts, and discover unique content from the Ashesi community.

- **Data Integrity Checks:** We take data accuracy seriously. During registration, our system verifies that the year group selected matches the last four digits of your student ID. This ensures consistent and accurate user registration.

- **Form Validation:** To maintain data integrity, all form fields must be completed appropriately. The application enforces this rule, accepting only eight-digit numerical values for the student ID field.

- **Year Group Validation:** We validate the last four digits of your student ID to ensure they correspond to a valid year. The year must not be earlier than 2002, the founding year of Ashesi.

- **Session Management:** Your privacy and security are paramount. Our session management system allows you to log in and access your unique details seamlessly.

- **Enhanced Security:** Users cannot make posts without creating an account, adding an extra layer of security to the platform.
